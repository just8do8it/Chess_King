	<h1>Solving the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube</h1>
	<p>Solving the Rubik's cube seems really complicated at first,<br>
		but once you start getting into it you realise it is pretty<br>
		easy, you just have to put some time and work.<br>
		There are a lot of ways to solve the 3x3x3 cube (the standart cube),<br>
		but for starters their is a easy begginer's method,<br>
		which involves only a few algorithms and you can learn<br>
		it in days. Here is a great video describing it:<br>

	<p>The most important thing when solving the cube is how much<br>
		time does it take you to do it. Speedcubing (also known as speedsolving) is the<br>
		hobby involving solving a variety of twisty puzzles, the most famous being the 3x3<br>
		puzzle or Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible. The need of solving the cube fast<br>
		has made it's way out in the form of faster cubes, and also faster methods for<br>
		solving them. The most popular method for speedcubing is called CFOP, standing for<br>
		Cross, F2L(first two layers), OLL(orienting last layer) and PLL(permuting last layer).<br>
		This method is complicated, because it takes a lot of practise to learn all the<br>
		necessary algorithms, and there are 30+ of them. Along the way you learn shortcuts<br>
		here and there and you might even invent an algorithm yourself. Because this method is<br>
		hard to learn, it can't really be explained in one video, so click the link below to see<br>
		a playlist of tutorials for CFOP.
